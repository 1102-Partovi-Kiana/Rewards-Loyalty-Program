- Developed a robust and scalable program leveraging object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to ensure
modular and maintainable codebase utilizing classes and inheritance
- Utilized SOLID principles, incorporating Single Responsibility for focused classes, Open/Closed for extensibility,
Liskov Substitution for interchangeability, Interface Segregation for precise interfaces, and Dependency Inversion for
modularity
- Conducted thorough unit testing on critical program functionalities using C++ testing frameworks and tools,
ensuring the program’s reliability and minimizing the risk of potential bugs
- Employed CMake build system to efficiently manage the project’s compilation process, enabling seamless
integration of new code and dependencies
